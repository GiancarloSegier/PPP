# Personal Passion Project
## Client
Daily smartphone user, myself, people who want to manage and control their income and expenses.

## Core Project Statement
Everyone has already experienced it. "To what or where have I spent all that money on?", "Maybe I should start paying more attention to my money", "every cent counts", and so on...

What if there was an app to manage and control all of this situations? An app where you can see your income and where your money went to. 

__In the app that I'm about to develop, you can do all of this:__
* enter your different accounts / bank cards
  * ex. work account, personal account, savings account, shared account
* enter your income / expenses per account
  * set fixed costs
  * set reminders to pay
* linking a shared account with another person
* a short graph / display where you have an overview of all income and expenses
* (find nearby ATM's + set route to it)

__In a perfect world you'll be able to do this:__
* scan your receipt
* connect your bankaccounts

## Minimum Deliverables
* Mobile application working on IOS & Android
