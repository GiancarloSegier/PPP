# Personal Passion Project
## Client
* Smartphone users who wants to go on a trip and learn more about the city they're in.
* People that want to make the effort to plan a trip.
* People that are open to connect with new people

## Core Project Statement
"What's this monument?".

"I can't find any information on this".

"Stupid tourguide, I can't find it...".

"I don't want to do this trip by myself".

These are some expressions some people have been confronted with.
Then I imagined. What if you had an app to scan monuments, to make your own trips, join someone else's trip or just do the trip of someone else? 

__In the app that I'm about to develop, you can do all of this:__
* Scan landmarks & get information about them
* Plan your own trip
  * A future trip
  * For instant use
* Save & share your trip
* Plan a party
  * For anyone or friends only
* Get a surprise trip
* Save other people's trips
* Comment & rate other people's trip
* Enter challenges & earn trophies

## Minimum Deliverables
* Mobile application working on IOS & Android
